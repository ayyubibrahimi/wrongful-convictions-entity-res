# Wrongful Conviction Data Processing Pipeline Stage 2

This repository is part of the IPNO's Wrongful Conviction Data Processing pipeline, focusing on the entity resolution and entity matching stage. 

## Overview

The Innocence Project New Orleans (IPNO) is dedicated to uncovering and rectifying wrongful convictions. 

## Stage 2: Entity Resolution and Matching

- **Purpose:** This stage involves identifying, matching, and resolving entities across our datasets. This process helps in consolidating information and reducing data discrepancies.

## Navigation through the Project

- **Previous Stage:** [US-IPNO Exonerations](https://github.com/ipno-llead/US-IPNO-exonerations) - Begin here to understand the initial analysis that set the stage for this repository's work.
- **Next Stage:** [Wrongful Conviction Network](https://github.com/ayyubibrahimi/wrongful-conviction-network) - Continue here after completing the work in this repository to see how we generated a network of actors tied to wrongful convictions.
